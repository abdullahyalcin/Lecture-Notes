`Cloud`: Storing and accesing data and prgorams
- Most important benefit of Cloud Computing is economy

`Cloud Computing Features`
- Cost Efficiency
- Elasticity & Flexibility

Cloud Computing architecture basically comprises of the two parts which are called Front-end and Back-end.  

``Cloud Consumer``  
``Cloud Provider``  
``Cloud Broker:`` acts as the intermediate between consumer and provider  
``Clourd Auditor``: provides a valuable inherent function for the government      
``Cloud Carrier``


## Service Models  
.
.
.  
`IaaS - Infrastructure as as Service  `  
it's Cloud Computing's most basic service and the instant computing infrastructure which servers manages and monitors over the internet.  

- Customers outsource their IT infrastructure including servers, networking, distribution, storage, virtual machines, and other tools.
- The complete management is done by the Cloud Service provider.
- The installation, configuration, and management of the software are complete by the customer.
- Customers access these services on an Internet-based pay-per-use model, i.e. cloud computing network.
- It provides all computing resources but in a virtual environment so that multiple users can access them.
- The resources used can be increased/decreased at any time by taking advantage of the flexible structure of Cloud Computing.  

`PaaS - Platform as a Service`  
- PaaS is a development framework for developers that is designed to create, test, run and manage applications for the programmer.  
- PaaS basically expands the IaaS layer by eliminating the virtual machine management problem.
- It not only includes server, storage, and networking but also database, tools, business services, and many more.
PaaS helps developers of applications to build their projects by offering layers of hardware and software.
- This service includes system management, operating system, a framework for the programming language, database, etc.
Because the service provider manages the system, you only manage applications and data.
- Some popular PAAS providers are AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure, etc.  

`SaaS - Software as a Service`  
- SaaS is a software distribution model in which applications are managed by a third-party provider and made available to customers on the Internet.  
- For many business applications such as business applications, it is one of the standard delivery models, including office software, messaging software, payroll processing software, and many more.   
- Often known as host software, on-demand software, and web-based software are the SaaS applications.
- It allows users to connect to and use cloud-based applications over the Internet.
E-mail, calendar, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365) are examples of these applications.
- Software as a Service (SaaS) is used by most leading organizations.  https://media.clarusway.com/aws/cloud-computing-basics/031-cc-basics.png  

`Virtualization`  

- Cloud computing virtualization is a mechanism in which cloud users share the data in the cloud that can be device applications, etc.
- Virtualization systems create a logical layer between the user and the hardware, preventing the user from directly accessing physical system resources.
- This layer is a logical layer called Hypervisor or VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor), called the core of virtualization, that receives user requests and transmits them appropriately to the hardware.
- A hypervisor is synchronization between the server and the virtual environment and distributes resources through different virtual environments.  

Some Virtualization types;  
- Hardware Virtualization
- Software Virtualization
- Server Virtualization
- Storage Virtualization
- Operating System - OS Virtualization  

`What is a Hypervisor`  
- is the key to enabling virtualization
- it's software installed on top of computer hardware, 
- creating the virtualization layer,
- acting as a platform for the VMs to be created on
- it manages the sharing of physical resources into virtual
